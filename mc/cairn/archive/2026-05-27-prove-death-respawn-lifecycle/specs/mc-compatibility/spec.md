# Delta: Death and respawn lifecycle proof

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Lifecycle model

r[mc_compatibility.prove_death_respawn_lifecycle.lifecycle_model] The death/respawn proof MUST define lifecycle states, allowed transitions, forbidden transitions, and server/client evidence requirements before claiming full lifecycle correctness.

#### Scenario: Lifecycle model scopes death and respawn claims

r[mc_compatibility.prove_death_respawn_lifecycle.lifecycle_model.scenario]
- GIVEN death/respawn correctness is being evaluated
- WHEN the lifecycle model is reviewed
- THEN each state and transition records expected server evidence, expected client observation, forbidden milestones, and non-claim status
- AND unmodeled transitions remain non-claims

### Requirement: Positive lifecycle scenarios

r[mc_compatibility.prove_death_respawn_lifecycle.positive_lifecycle_scenarios] Valid death/respawn transitions MUST have positive scenarios that correlate Valence lifecycle state with Stevenarella observations.

#### Scenario: Valid lifecycle transition is observed

r[mc_compatibility.prove_death_respawn_lifecycle.positive_lifecycle_scenarios.scenario]
- GIVEN a valid lifecycle transition row is selected
- WHEN the scenario runs
- THEN Valence records the authoritative death/respawn state and Stevenarella records the expected user-visible observation
- AND the receipt records no missing lifecycle milestones for that row

### Requirement: Negative lifecycle scenarios

r[mc_compatibility.prove_death_respawn_lifecycle.negative_lifecycle_scenarios] Lifecycle verification MUST reject duplicate, missing, forbidden, or out-of-order death/respawn evidence.

#### Scenario: Invalid lifecycle evidence fails

r[mc_compatibility.prove_death_respawn_lifecycle.negative_lifecycle_scenarios.scenario]
- GIVEN lifecycle evidence contains a duplicate, missing, forbidden, or out-of-order transition
- WHEN the runner evaluates the row
- THEN the row fails with explicit diagnostics
- AND no full death/respawn lifecycle claim is promoted

### Requirement: Lifecycle promotion gate

r[mc_compatibility.prove_death_respawn_lifecycle.lifecycle_promotion_gate] Full death/respawn lifecycle correctness MUST remain a non-claim until required lifecycle rows have passing deterministic tests, live receipts, BLAKE3 manifests, and evidence index updates.

#### Scenario: Lifecycle promotion requires row coverage

r[mc_compatibility.prove_death_respawn_lifecycle.lifecycle_promotion_gate.scenario]
- GIVEN full death/respawn lifecycle correctness is proposed
- WHEN any required lifecycle row lacks passing evidence
- THEN promotion is rejected
- AND the current bundle keeps lifecycle breadth as a non-claim
