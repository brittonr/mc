# repository-layout Change Spec: Cairn policy ownership

## Requirements

### Requirement: Cairn policy ownership contract

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.contract] The repository MUST document ownership, generation command, schema constraints, and path rationale for generated Cairn policy artifacts.

#### Scenario: Policy owner is clear

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.contract.owner]
- GIVEN a generated Cairn policy file exists in the repository
- WHEN a developer reads layout or lifecycle docs
- THEN the docs name the owning lifecycle system, generation command, expected schema compatibility, and path rationale.

### Requirement: Cairn policy reference inventory

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.references] Policy path changes MUST be preceded by an inventory of code, flake, docs, checks, and Cairn validation references to the current policy path.

#### Scenario: Embedded path is found

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.references.embedded]
- GIVEN a policy path is embedded in a command, flake check, docs page, or validation script
- WHEN the reference inventory runs
- THEN the reference is recorded with owner and migration action before any path move.

### Requirement: Cairn policy path decision

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.path_decision] The repository MAY keep `cairn-policy/` top-level or migrate it under `cairn/` only after recording compatibility with the pinned Cairn binary and validation commands.

#### Scenario: Path move is compatibility-proven

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.path_decision.compat]
- GIVEN maintainers decide to move generated policy artifacts
- WHEN path migration is implemented
- THEN the repo-pinned Cairn validation and policy checks accept the new or configured path
- AND old path references are updated or intentionally retained with migration notes.

### Requirement: Cairn policy freshness

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.freshness] Generated Cairn policy artifacts SHOULD have freshness or schema-compatibility checks that fail when checked-in policy output is stale or incompatible.

#### Scenario: Stale policy fails

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.freshness.stale]
- GIVEN policy source inputs change without refreshing generated policy artifacts
- WHEN policy freshness validation runs
- THEN the stale policy artifact is reported
- AND archive is blocked until regeneration or an explicit compatibility decision occurs.

### Requirement: Cairn policy docs

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.docs] README, architecture, or agent notes SHOULD explain how generated Cairn policy artifacts are maintained and validated.

#### Scenario: Regeneration command is discoverable

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.docs.command]
- GIVEN a developer needs to refresh Cairn policy output
- WHEN they inspect lifecycle docs
- THEN they can find the repo-pinned command, expected output path, and validation check.

### Requirement: Cairn policy validation

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.validation] Cairn policy ownership changes MUST record Cairn validation, policy freshness/schema checks, and Cairn gates before archive.

#### Scenario: Policy closeout is reviewable

r[repository_layout.cairn_policy_ownership.validation.log]
- GIVEN Cairn policy ownership or path docs have changed
- WHEN the change is archived
- THEN reviewable logs show Cairn validation, policy freshness or schema checks, any path compatibility checks, Cairn proposal/design/tasks gates, and Cairn validation.
