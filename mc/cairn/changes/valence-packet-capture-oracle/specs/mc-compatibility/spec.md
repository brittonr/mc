# Mc Compatibility Delta: Valence packet capture oracle

## Requirements

### Requirement: Compatibility testing

r[mc_compatibility.valence_packet_capture.headless_cli] Valence compatibility testing MUST provide a headless packet-capture oracle for local owned client/server runs.

#### Scenario: Capture starts for a local run

r[mc_compatibility.valence_packet_capture.headless_cli.scenario]

- GIVEN a local Valence example and client probe are selected

- WHEN the capture oracle is invoked

- THEN the oracle records direction, protocol state, packet id, decode status, and bounded timing metadata

### Requirement: Packet-capture evidence

r[mc_compatibility.valence_packet_capture.redacted_receipt] Packet-capture evidence MUST be normalized and redacted before it is recorded as durable evidence.

#### Scenario: Receipt omits raw sensitive traffic

r[mc_compatibility.valence_packet_capture.redacted_receipt.scenario]

- GIVEN packet capture data is converted into a receipt

- WHEN the receipt is written

- THEN the receipt includes normalized packet summaries and decode failures

- AND the receipt excludes raw payload dumps unless an explicit local debug artifact is requested

### Requirement: Packet-capture receipts

r[mc_compatibility.valence_packet_capture.triage_correlation] Packet-capture receipts MUST correlate with scenario triage when a compatibility run fails.

#### Scenario: Capture points at failing boundary

r[mc_compatibility.valence_packet_capture.triage_correlation.scenario]

- GIVEN a scenario receipt reports a protocol-runtime or client-probe failure

- WHEN the packet capture summary is attached or compared

- THEN the combined evidence identifies the first relevant packet/state boundary when available
