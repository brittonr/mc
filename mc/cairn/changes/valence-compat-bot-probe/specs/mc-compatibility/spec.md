# Mc Compatibility Delta: Valence compat bot probe

## Requirements

### Requirement: Compatibility testing

r[mc_compatibility.valence_compat_bot.safe_bounded_probe] Valence compatibility testing MUST provide a bounded owned bot/probe mode derived from the Hyperion bot pattern without enabling unbounded public stress traffic.

#### Scenario: Probe run is bounded

r[mc_compatibility.valence_compat_bot.safe_bounded_probe.scenario]

- GIVEN the operator selects the compat bot probe

- WHEN the probe is started against a local owned Valence example

- THEN the run uses bounded clients, duration, and target address controls

- AND the receipt records that it does not authorize external-server load testing

### Requirement: The compat bot probe

r[mc_compatibility.valence_compat_bot.semantic_receipt] The compat bot probe MUST emit deterministic semantic receipts for client-side milestones and non-claims.

#### Scenario: Receipt records milestones

r[mc_compatibility.valence_compat_bot.semantic_receipt.scenario]

- GIVEN the probe completes or fails

- WHEN the runner writes its receipt

- THEN the receipt records required, observed, and missing client milestones

- AND the receipt records target, duration/window, scenario, and explicit non-claims

### Requirement: The compat bot probe

r[mc_compatibility.valence_compat_bot.valence_gate] The compat bot probe MUST be covered by a focused deterministic gate before live acceptance evidence is claimed.

#### Scenario: Dry-run gate validates receipt shape

r[mc_compatibility.valence_compat_bot.valence_gate.scenario]

- GIVEN the probe surface exists

- WHEN the deterministic gate runs in Nix dry-run mode

- THEN the gate validates schema, scenario, milestone, and non-claim fields
