# Delta: Evidence freshness gates

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Cross-file freshness

r[mc_compatibility.harden_evidence_freshness_gates.cross_file_freshness] Evidence freshness checks MUST verify consistency among acceptance matrix rows, current bundle rows, receipt copies, run logs, and BLAKE3 manifests.

#### Scenario: Freshness checker rejects drift

r[mc_compatibility.harden_evidence_freshness_gates.cross_file_freshness.scenario]
- GIVEN evidence rows are indexed for maintained compatibility claims
- WHEN the freshness checker runs
- THEN it verifies referenced artifacts exist, recorded BLAKE3 hashes match file contents, and matrix/current-bundle rows agree on scoped claims
- AND it fails on missing, stale, or contradictory evidence

### Requirement: Freshness fixtures

r[mc_compatibility.harden_evidence_freshness_gates.freshness_fixtures] The evidence freshness checker MUST include positive and negative fixtures for complete rows, stale hashes, missing matrix rows, missing bundle rows, missing run logs, and target-only receipts.

#### Scenario: Stale artifact fixtures fail closed

r[mc_compatibility.harden_evidence_freshness_gates.freshness_fixtures.scenario]
- GIVEN freshness fixtures are executed
- WHEN a fixture contains a stale hash, missing row, missing artifact, or target-only live receipt
- THEN the checker fails with explicit diagnostics
- AND no evidence promotion can rely on that fixture

### Requirement: Reviewable artifacts

r[mc_compatibility.harden_evidence_freshness_gates.reviewable_artifacts] Review-critical live receipts and logs MUST be copied under `docs/evidence/` with BLAKE3 manifests before they are cited by tasks, matrix rows, or bundle rows.

#### Scenario: Target-only evidence is rejected

r[mc_compatibility.harden_evidence_freshness_gates.reviewable_artifacts.scenario]
- GIVEN a task, matrix row, or bundle row cites a live receipt
- WHEN the cited artifact exists only under `target/`
- THEN the gate rejects the promotion
- AND the task must either copy the artifact under `docs/evidence/` or record an explicit historical/oracle decision

### Requirement: Promotion gate

r[mc_compatibility.harden_evidence_freshness_gates.promotion_gate] New or replaced compatibility evidence rows MUST run the documented promotion gate before claims are broadened or receipt hashes are updated.

#### Scenario: Promotion gate is required for row updates

r[mc_compatibility.harden_evidence_freshness_gates.promotion_gate.scenario]
- GIVEN a compatibility evidence row is added or its receipt hash changes
- WHEN the change is reviewed
- THEN the matrix checker, current-bundle checker, manifest checker, Cairn validation, and row-specific dry-run gate have tracked output or evidence
- AND promotion is blocked if any gate fails
